# Data-_Analyisis_using_Python

I completed an end-to-end data analysis project using Python on a City hotel dataset. The project involved data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and modeling to identify factors that contribute to booking cancellations. Based on the findings, I provided several suggestions to the hotel management to decrease the cancellation rate, such as improving the booking process, offering incentives for non-cancellation, and providing better customer service. Overall, the project highlights the power of data analysis in improving business decision-making and optimizing operations.
